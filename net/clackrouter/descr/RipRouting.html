<p>
A RIP routing module sends and receives RIP routing updates, which contain a list of reachability information
entries that include a network destination prefix, a next-hop and a cost to reach the destination from that 
next hop.  The RIP module installs routes into the routing table used by a forwarding component such as IPRouteLookup
</p>

<p>  The RIP routing module has only two ports:  The input port is for receiving updates, and the ouput 
for sending updates.
