<p>Clack element;
Introduces an additional configurable amount of delay for all packets passed through it.

<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>

<p> Has one input and one output port, both of which are pull ports.  This
element never initiates a pull, but rather only pulls on its input port when a connected elemented
has pulled on its output port. This is so that it can be placed between an outgoing interface
and the head of a queue.  Since Clack only queues packets in explicite queues, this is the only location 
you should place it.  
</p>
<p>
 A Delay element <i> adds </i> a specified amount of delay (in milliseconds) to all packets that flow through it.
 It is important to realize that the actual delay experienced by the packet is the base latency experienced when 
 the delay of this component is set to zero, plus whatever the configured delay is.  The Delay component tries its
 best to be accurate to the delay time, but may sometimes introduce delays greater than the specified amount (but never less).
