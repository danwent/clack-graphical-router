<p>Clack element;
Throttles the speed of packets through it by a configurable percentage of overall speed.

<p>Pull</p>

<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>

<p> Has one input and one output port, both of which are pull ports.  This
element never initiates a pull, but rather only pulls on its input port when a connected elemented
has pulled on its output port. This is so that it can be placed between an outgoing interface
and the head of a queue.  Since Clack only queues packets in explicite queues, this is the only location 
you should place it.  
</p>
<p>
 A Throttle element slows packets to a <i> percentage P of the normal router speed </i>.
 Essentially,  when its output is pulled on, it will issue a pull on its input port P 
 percent of the time.  Thus, a value of P = 100 results in no throttling.  
 The value of P can be dynamically configured.
